Should I go with donor egg or self egg", "actualOutput": "I understand your situation and the dilemma you're facing. It can be difficult to decide whether to proceed with donor eggs or try with your own eggs, especially with a low AMH level. Several factors should be considered like success rates, costs, and your personal preferences. We have seen that fresh eggs have slightly higher success rates but are more expensive, while frozen eggs offer more flexibility and lower costs, with potentially slightly lower success rates. Many women with low AMH still consider trying IVF with their own eggs before moving to donor eggs. Have you tried IVF with your own eggs before, or is this your first IVF cycle?", "retrievalContext": ["Treating women with a low AMH level Some patients will say, \"I don't want to waste my time and money in doing IVF with my own eggs if the success rate is low, so let me just go for donor eggs, as this maximizes my chances of having a baby.

Once the donor's egg are mature, she will have to go through the egg retrieval process. She will be superovulated to harvest many eggs in one cycle. These eggs are frozen, which means they can be thawed, fertilised with your husband's sperm, and the resulting embryos then transferred into your uterus when your uterine lining is receptive. The spare embryos can be frozen and then used in the future as needed.SummaryHaving an IVF with donor eggs is common, especially when the woman is past the age of 40 or she has unusable eggs. With young donors, the eggs are fertile and the chances of success are much higher.", "Treating women with a low AMH level Treating women with poor ovarian reserve (as defined by a low AMH level and a low antral follicle\u00c2 count\u00c2 ) can be extremely difficult. A lot of these patients don't know what they should do because they get so much conflicting advice. Should they be trying IVF with their own eggs ? with aggressive superovulation ? or with minimal stimulation ? Or should they continue trying in their own bedroom ?\u00c2 or should they use donor eggs? Does it make sense to spend so much money on an IVF cycle if the success rate is going to be so poor?\u00c2 However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to accept that you will need to use donor eggs, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not easy to come to terms with the fact that your baby will not carry your own DNA. This is why so many older women start obsessing about their AMH level. They\u00c2 track it religiously, and will try anything to get it to improve. They also go from one doctor to another , trying to find someone who will tell them what they want to hear. The reality is that we don't actually treat an AMH number \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we treat patients. In one sense, it doesn't matter whether your absolute number is 0.6 or 1.0 - we know that if the AMH is low, this means you have poor ovarian reserve and will most probably have a poor ovarian response to superovulation, which is why your chances of getting pregnant with IVF will be lesser as compared to someone with a normal AMH. However, the chance is not zero, and this doesn't mean that you should not attempt IVF with your own eggs. After all, these are decisions based on personal patient preference - not on lab values. These decisions are too important to be left to the doctor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they should be made by you, because you're the one who needs to live with the consequence of that decision. As a doctor, I can counsel you as regards your success rates, and while it is true that the pregnancy rates with donor egg will definitely be better as compared to using your own eggs, it's not a simple black or white decision. The whole point is there is no right answer , because every patient is different.", "Is donor egg IVF the right option for you? The attitudes of patients towards having to use donor eggs can vary a lot! Many older women have poor ovarian reserve, and they know that the best way of having a healthy baby is to use donor eggs. However, lots of them find it very difficult to come to terms with this. They believe - It's not going to be my child because my baby is not going to carry my DNA. This is why they point-blank reject this option and refuse to explore it. On the other hand, there are other women who say, \"Look, at the end of the day all I want is a baby. The DNA doesn't really matter, because as long as I love the baby, this will by my child.\" They are very happy to accept this option, and are grateful that not only are there young women who are happy to donate their eggs, they're also pleased that the technology exists today to take advantage of this treatment something which simply wasn't available 40 years ago. The acceptability of using donor eggs depends on the attitude of the patient and what they really want from fertility treatment the propagation of their DNA? the pleasure of experiencing pregnancy? or the joy of bringing up a baby?
